# googleadsR 1.0.0

Change the name of the `windsor_fetch_googleAds` function to `fetch_googleads`.
Delete argument `date_present` and add `date_from` and `date_to` instead. Include default arguments so the function downloads data for the last week if these arguments are not specified.
Include changing the class of the data to numeric and character in each case.
